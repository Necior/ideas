# ideas

People tend to come up with - mostly useless - ideas. Instead of letting these ideas occupy a mind of mine, I scribe them in this repository.

## Rock-paper-scissors

* mobile
* multiplayer (both online and offline)
* rankings, tournaments
* statistics
* possibility of playing many games at the same time

## DelayFS

* provides files with a configurable (including random) delay
* might be useful for testing (e.g. testing responsiveness of user interface)
* possible usage: `delayfs /tmp/files /tmp/delayed_files`

## TodoFS

* tasks as directories
* mark done tasks using a starting dot in the name of a directory (`rm` would rename in this case)
* not-directories are regular files which are attachments to the task
* related idea: filesystem for Wunderlist or similar todo service

## Linkbin

* one-user web application to store URLs
* title + (URL xor text)
* use Google Authenticator or similar one-time password system

## Reading assistant

* keep a list of known words (by a user)
* find new words in a given text and let a user mark them as known or unknown (or use a scale: "I know a definition", "I intuitively understand", "I've seen this word", "It's completely new")
* generate flashcards with new words for a given text

## Tinder for food

* keep a list of ingredients in a house
* compare available dishes with a recipes database
* show possible dishes (sorted by calories or overall "quality" of a dish)
