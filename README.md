# ideas

People tend to come up with - mostly useless - ideas. Instead of letting these ideas occupy a mind of mine, I scribe them in this repository.

## Rock-paper-scissors

* mobile
* multiplayer (both online and offline)
* rankings, tournaments
* statistics
* possibility of playing many games at the same time

## DelayFS

* provides files with a configurable (including random) delay
* might be useful for testing (e.g. testing responsiveness of user interface)
* possible usage: `delayfs /tmp/files /tmp/delayed_files`

## TodoFS

* tasks as directories
* mark done tasks using a starting dot in the name of a directory (`rm` would rename in this case)
* not-directories are regular files which are attachments to the task
* related idea: filesystem for Wunderlist or similar todo service
